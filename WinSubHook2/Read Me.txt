======================================================================
WinSubHook2 - module-less, ide safe, machine code thunk classes for...

  Subclassing
  Windows hooks
  Api windows
  Timers

For use with Forms, Usercontrols and classes.
======================================================================

Check out the sample projects... (NB: Some are new, those that aren't have been rewritten)

  'Api window demo, also visibly demonstrates thunk survival after ide stop.
  Samples\ApiWindow\prjApiWindow.vbp	

  'System-wide keyboard hook demo with active application tracking.
  Samples\HooKey\prjHooKey.vbp

  'System-wide mouse hook demo.
  Samples\HookMouse\prjHookMouse.vbp

  'Compiled in Shadow/fade control	
  Samples\Shadow\prjShadow.vbp	

  'Standalone Shadow/fade control ocx	
  Samples\Shadow ocx\prjShadowCtl.vbp	

  'Subclass demo
  Samples\Sublass\prjShadowCtl.vbp	

  'Formless timer demo
  Samples\Timer\prjTimer.vbp		

To use the thunks with your own applications you'll want to register the type library.
  Type Lib\WinSubHook2.tlb

  One way to do this is to run the following project...
  Utility\RegisterTLB\prjRegisterTlb.vbp

If you need a WinSubHook2 thunk in your project just add the appropriate class file...
  Thunks\cHook.cls	- Windows hooks
  Thunks\cSubclass.cls	- Window subclasser
  Thunks\cTimer.cls	- Formless timer
  Thunks\cWindow.cls	- API Window
		
Add a reference to this Type Library...
  "WinSubHook 2 interface 1.03"

Or from the Project\References dialog 'Browse' to this file
  Type Lib\WinSubHook2.tlb

Note: Type libraries are NOT required to execute a compiled application... 
IOW, they shouldn't be included in setup packages.
	
In a Form, Class or UserControl add the appropriate implements statement in the module global area at the top of the file
  Implements WinSubHook2.iHook 
  Implements WinSubHook2.iSubclass
  Implements WinSubHook2.iTimer
  Implements WinSubHook2.iWindow	

Select the implemented interface from the left dropdown combo in the editor window and...
code the interface

The assembler model code can be viewed here...
  Asm\Hook.asm 
  Asm\Subclass.asm
  Asm\Timer.asm
  Asm\Window.asm

For more on assembler see...
  Asm\Read Me.txt

To extract a VB string representation of the machine code from a binary (.bin) file... as used in the thunks.
  Utility\McXtract

For a sample Visual C++ hook dll see... Samples\Hook Global - C++\
Some types of system-wide hook aren't possible with VB, the code here nearly ended up as part of the HooKey sample. See the "Read Me.txt" file for more information.
