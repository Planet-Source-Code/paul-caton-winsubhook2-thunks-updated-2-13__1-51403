//
// This now just an "educational" sample. HooKey uses a previously undocumented api call to achieve the same end.
// Just a couple of usage notes, seeing as you now can't see how HooKey uses this DLL.
//
// In your VB app...
// Create a unique message number using the RegisterWindowMessage api
// Setup a cSubclasser instance
// AddMsg the unique message number, MSG_BEFORE
// Call HookStart
// Do whatever in the implemented interface callback
// AND don't forget to call HookStop when you're through - Though I've added code to uninstall the hook
// should the app that called HookStart stop... let's start as we mean to carry on.. with care.
//

//
// TrkWnd.dll installs a system-wide CBT hook into all running window processes. When the hook receives an app activation
// notification it posts a message to the application that installed the hook. The message includes
// the Window handle of the application that's just about to activate plus whether the mouse was used to effect the change.
//
// Why? HooKey does a good job with the system-wide keyboard hook, it's no huge deal to capture global keystrokes in a VB 
// application. However, it's all very well to know what's being typed, but what app is it being typed into? For that we need 
// a hook that resides in a *true* dll... not the com oddity that VB produces. So for now we need the assistance of Visual C.
//
// With regard to HooKey and Planet-Source-Code's restriction on binary uploads... and bearing in mind that some of you
// wont have access to Visual C++ 6 - I will package the dll into HooKey's resource file and arrange for HooKey to write
// TrkWnd.dll to the application directory if it isn't found.
